# LandingPage---Say-Your-Bet

A Landing Page for the company Say Your Bet. I built the page in two weeks (just the code, no design)

I used:  **MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js**. 

The challenge was a button able to translate from French to English, therefore I used Redux.

How to open the LandingPage---Say-Your-Bet ? 
1) Download the file
2) Open the terminal and clone this repository
3) Write **npm install**, to install all the modules
4) Write **npm start**
5) In another terminal, go into the file and write **npm run bundle**. The sentence "webpack is watching the files" should appear.
6) On google, go to **localhost:3000**
